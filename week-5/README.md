# Rock Paper Scissors – Python Console Game

## Project Description
This project is a Rock Paper Scissors game created using Python.  
The game runs in the terminal and allows the user to play against the computer.

The user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors by entering a number, and the computer randomly selects its choice.  
Both choices are displayed using ASCII art, and the program determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

---

## How the Game Works
1. The user is prompted to enter:
   - 0 for Rock  
   - 1 for Paper  
   - 2 for Scissors  
2. The program displays the ASCII art for the user’s choice.
3. The computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 2.
4. The program displays the ASCII art for the computer’s choice.
5. The program compares both choices and displays the result:
   - You win
   - You lose
   - It’s a draw
6. The game can repeat until the user quits.

## Game Rules
- Rock beats Scissors  
- Scissors beats Paper  
- Paper beats Rock  
- If both the user and the computer choose the same option, the game is a draw

## Concepts Used in This Project
- Variables and data types
- Lists and list indexing
- User input and input validation
- Random number generation
- Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
- Loops (while loop)
- ASCII art output
- Program flow using a flowchart

## Example Output
What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors: 2

You chose: Scissors
[ASCII Art]

Computer chose: Paper
[ASCII Art]

You win!
