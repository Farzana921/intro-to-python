# Week 02 – Pizza Order Practice

This week focuses on practicing conditional statements in Python using a simple pizza ordering program.

## Project

- **pizza_order.py**  
  A program that calculates the final price of a pizza based on:
  - Pizza size (S, M, L)
  - Pepperoni option
  - Extra cheese option

## Concepts Practiced

- `if / elif / else`
- User input
- Case handling using `.upper()`
- Basic arithmetic
- Program logic

## Goal

To understand how conditional statements work and how user choices affect program output.
