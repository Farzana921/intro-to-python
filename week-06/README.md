## Week 06 – Password Generator Practice

This project focuses on practicing loops and randomization in Python by building a simple password generator.

### Project
- **password_generator.py**  
  A program that generates a random password based on:
  - Number of letters
  - Number of numbers
  - Number of symbols

### Concepts Practiced
- `for` loops
- User input using `input()`
- Random selection with `random.choice()`
- String concatenation
- Basic program flow

### Goal
To understand how loops work in Python and how user input can control the output of a program.
