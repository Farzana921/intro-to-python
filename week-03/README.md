# Week 03 – Treasure Island Game

This project is a simple text-based adventure game created using Python.  
It focuses on practicing conditional statements and user input through a fun, interactive game.

---

## Project Description

- **treasure-island.py**  
  A Python program where the player must make the correct choices to find hidden treasure.
  The game asks the player a series of questions and each choice leads to a different outcome.

The goal is to reach the treasure by following the correct path.

## How the Game Works

- The game starts with an ASCII art introduction.
- The player is welcomed to Treasure Island.
- The player makes choices at different stages of the game.
- Incorrect choices result in *Game Over*.
- One correct path leads to winning the treasure.

## Concepts Practiced

- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- User input using `input()`
- Handling input case using `.lower()` and `.upper()`
- Nested conditionals
- Program logic and flow control

## Goal

The goal of this project is to strengthen understanding of conditional statements in Python and to practice building an interactive program that responds to user choices.
